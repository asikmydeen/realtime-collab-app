# Infinite Canvas Architecture

## Overview
A real-time collaborative infinite canvas where millions of users can draw simultaneously across a virtually unlimited space.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Canvas Chunking System
- Canvas divided into 512x512 pixel chunks
- Each chunk has unique coordinates (chunkX, chunkY)
- Chunks are lazy-loaded based on viewport
- Only visible chunks are rendered

### 2. Coordinate System
```
World Coordinates: (-∞, -∞) to (+∞, +∞)
Chunk Coordinates: (worldX / 512, worldY / 512)
Local Coordinates: (worldX % 512, worldY % 512)
```

### 3. Data Structure
```javascript
{
  chunks: Map<string, Chunk>,
  activeRegions: Map<string, Set<userId>>,
  viewport: { x, y, width, height, zoom }
}

Chunk = {
  id: "x:y",
  lastModified: timestamp,
  compressed: boolean,
  data: Uint8Array, // Compressed image data
  operations: [] // Recent operations for real-time sync
}
```

## Scalability Solutions

### 1. Region-Based Rooms
- Canvas divided into regions (16x16 chunks)
- Users only join WebSocket rooms for visible regions
- Automatic room switching during pan/zoom
- Maximum 100 users per room (load balanced)

### 2. Level of Detail (LOD)
- Zoom Level 0-0.5x: Show pre-rendered thumbnails
- Zoom Level 0.5-2x: Show compressed chunks
- Zoom Level 2x+: Show full resolution with live updates

### 3. Hybrid Networking
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates in visible area
- **WebRTC**: P2P chunk sharing between nearby users
- **HTTP**: Chunk fetching and persistence
- **CDN**: Cached chunk delivery

## Client Architecture

### 1. Viewport Manager
```javascript
class ViewportManager {
  - Track visible chunks
  - Request chunks on demand
  - Manage render queue
  - Handle zoom/pan events
}
```

### 2. Chunk Cache
```javascript
class ChunkCache {
  - LRU cache (100MB limit)
  - Progressive loading
  - Background prefetching
  - Memory management
}
```

### 3. Render Pipeline
1. **Immediate Layer**: Live strokes being drawn
2. **Chunk Layer**: Rendered chunk images
3. **Preview Layer**: Low-res previews for zoomed out view
4. **UI Layer**: Cursors, labels, minimap

## Server Architecture

### 1. Microservices
- **Canvas Service**: Chunk management and persistence
- **Sync Service**: Real-time WebSocket coordination
- **Render Service**: Chunk compression and thumbnails
- **Analytics Service**: Heatmaps and statistics

### 2. Data Flow
```
User Draw → Region Server → Chunk Buffer → 
  ↓
  Broadcast to Region → Batch Write to DB
  ↓
  CDN Invalidation → Chunk Re-render
```

### 3. Storage Strategy
- **Hot Storage** (Redis): Active chunks (< 1 hour old)
- **Warm Storage** (PostgreSQL): Recent chunks (< 24 hours)
- **Cold Storage** (S3): Historical chunks (compressed)

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Client-Side
- Virtual scrolling with canvas recycling
- Offscreen canvas for chunk preparation
- Web Workers for decompression
- RequestAnimationFrame batching
- Pointer event coalescing

### 2. Server-Side
- Chunk diff compression
- Operation deduplication
- Geographically distributed servers
- Edge caching for popular regions
- Adaptive quality based on load

### 3. Network
- Binary WebSocket messages
- Delta compression for updates
- Predictive chunk prefetching
- Connection pooling

## Features

### 1. Navigation
- **Minimap**: Real-time overview with heatmap
- **Coordinates**: Jump to any location
- **Bookmarks**: Save interesting areas
- **Following**: Follow other users' viewports

### 2. Collaboration
- **Proximity Chat**: Voice chat with nearby users
- **Territories**: Claim and protect areas
- **Layers**: Multiple drawing layers
- **Time Machine**: View canvas history

### 3. Tools
- **Drawing**: Pen, brush, shapes, text
- **Selection**: Copy/paste regions
- **Filters**: Apply effects to areas
- **Stickers**: Place interactive elements
