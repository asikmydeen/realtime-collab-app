# üî• Deploy Your WebSocket Server RIGHT NOW (1 minute)

## The Problem
- ‚úÖ Your client is on Vercel (working)
- ‚ùå Vercel CANNOT host WebSocket servers
- üéØ You need a different platform for the server

## Fastest Solution: Railway (1 click deploy)

### Step 1: Deploy Server
**Click this button to deploy instantly:**

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/github/asikmydeen/realtime-collab-app)

Or manually:
1. Go to: https://railway.app/new
2. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select: `asikmydeen/realtime-collab-app`
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Click the deployment ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Generate Domain
6. Copy your domain (like `realtime-collab-app.up.railway.app`)

### Step 2: Update Vercel
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - Name: `VITE_WS_URL`
   - Value: `wss://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app`
5. Redeploy

## Alternative: Use Public WebSocket Test Server

For immediate testing, update your `client/src/config.js`:
```javascript
export const config = {
  wsUrl: 'wss://socketsbay.com/wss/v2/1/demo/'
};
```

This will let you test, but won't save drawings.

## Why This is Happening

- Vercel = Great for static sites & React apps ‚úÖ
- Vercel = Cannot do WebSockets ‚ùå
- You need: Vercel (client) + Railway/Render (server)

## Working Example

Here's a working collaborative drawing app for reference:
- Client: Vercel
- Server: Railway
- Try it: Open in 2 browsers and draw!
